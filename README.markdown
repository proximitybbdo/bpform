Instructions:
-------------

Create a clients directory with the following structure:

* /clients
  * /client-name
    * /project-name

All SWF-files dropped in the `project-name` folder will be deployed automatically. You can overwrite newer versions, they will be versioned inside the deploy folder.
SWF must follow the following naming convention: CLIENT_PROJECT_WIDTHxHEIGHT_LANG.swf

For example: ING_EndOfYear_728x90_NL.swf
